# Problem 1:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script>
 alert( "Iâ€™m JavaScript!");
 </script>
 Whats the error in this ?
</body>
</html>
```
At the end of alert single quote is used instead of double quote



# Problem 2:
```html
In the problem the file names are fix.html and scripts.js
So, while linking JS file the name should be same
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```


# Problem 3: 
The content in the linked script.js file will be called. so, first
alert with content "I'm JavaScript!" wil be displayed and then
alert with content "Hello" will be displayed even there is no semicolon 
and then alert with content "Wor" and "ld" in the next line as back ticks are used and then 
alert with content 6(1+2+3) will be displayed.



# Problem 4:
Add a space between Guvi and geek like this
```javascript

# Problem 5: 
Instead of using single quotes, back ticks should be used.
```javascript
alert( `hello ${name}` );
```



# Problem 6:
convert variables a and b to parseInt before adding
```javascript
let a = prompt("First number?");
let b = prompt("Second number?");
a = +a
b = +b
alert(a + b);
```



# Problem 7:
Strings "2" and "12" need to be converted to numbers
```javascript
var a = parseInt("2") > parseInt("12");
//Don't touch below this
if (a) {
  console.log("Code is Blasted")
}
else
{
  console.log("Diffused") 
}
```

let login = 'Employee';
let message = (login == 'Employee') ? "welcome to employee" : (login == 'Director') ? 'Greetings' : (login == '') ? 'No login' : '';
console.log(message);
```



# Problem 11:
console.log() should be in the "if" logic
```javascript
let message;
if (null || 2 || undefined )
{
 let message = "welcome boss";
 console.log(message);
}

{
 let message = "Go away";

}
console.log(message);
```



# Problem 13:

```javascript
let message;
let lock = 0;
//Dont change any code below this
if (lock && " " || undefined )

console.log(num += 1)
```




# Problem 16:

}
```

let countdown = 100;
while (countdown > 0) {
  if(countdown == 0)
  {
   console.log("bomb triggered");
  }
